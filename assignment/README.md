## What to do
### Database
1. Read and study the problem description carefully.
2. Identify the entities, attributes and relationships from the problem description.

3. Construct a list of API endpoints based on the assignment use cases.
4. Present the API endpoints along with request and response model using swagger documentation.
5. Develop API logic with proper validation, logging and error handling.
6. Submit source code into this `assignment` directory.

## Expected Outcome
### Database
- Entity relationship diagram to represent the database structure.
